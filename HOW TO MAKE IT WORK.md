okay so to play this you must have pygame installed in your pc along with python OBV
so what i need u to do is save the main.py file
and cut paste all the other images for the game into the directory where the main.py is saved


if you have pycharm then just cut paste the immage files in users/'your user name'/mypycharmprojects/'the project name'/
save it along main.py and u r good to go
